1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
  An ArrayList of dogs
  3 Dogs
  an Animal Comparator


3. Can you spot the comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the comparator?
  The constructor is called when sorting the collection(line 16), and because
  the comparator is an anonymous class, it is being defined right where it is being called.
